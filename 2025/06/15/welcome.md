# Welcome

**Published on:** 2025/06/15

**Tags:** blog, meta

This is **barrahome.org**, a personal space to write about technology, servers and whatever comes up.

The blog works in the simplest way possible: markdown files served directly by nginx, no static generators, no databases, no JavaScript frameworks. Just plain text converted to HTML on the fly.

## Why a blog like this

- **Simplicity**: one `.md` file per post, organized by date
- **No dependencies**: no build step, no deploy pipeline
- **Fast**: nginx serves the files directly, the markdown module converts on the fly
- **Durable**: as long as there's a server with nginx and the module, it works

## What you'll find here

Notes on Linux server administration, nginx configuration, software experiments, and anything I find worth documenting.
